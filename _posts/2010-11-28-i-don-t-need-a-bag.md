How many times do you actually need a plastic or paper bag when buying something?  Take for example, a sub from Subway or hamburger from Wendy's.  Or, when you are just buying some cheese from the grocery store.  Or, one or two items from any store.  The only time I can think of is if you get french fries, because apparently our fry-containing technology has not progressed since 1950.

If companies defaulted to not bagging instead of automatically bagging for one item, both business owners and environmentalists could be happy.  How much money could companies save if they didn't have to give a bag away for each single-item purchases?  How many bags could be saved if we didn't use them to carry single-item purchases?

It'd be an easy way for companies to claim 'greenness', and save me from having to ask *not* to have my item bagged every time.  Because isn't that what we're all working toward?  Not having to talk to anyone anymore in daily transactions?
