Ann Arbor exhales as U-Haul trucks and packed SUVs jump curbs out of town. The students who make up a quarter of the city's population leave town for the summer. Just when restaurants begin opening up patios, they find their usual customer has an internship in D.C.

After the exodus, those left behind get to stretch out.

The coffee shops have empty tables. The bike lanes feel wider. You can actually find parking on State Street. The farmers market at Kerrytown becomes navigable instead of a contact sport.

There's a particular quality to summer light in Michigan — it comes in at a slant, golden and warm, and lingers until nearly 10pm. The days feel impossibly long after the compressed darkness of winter.

I've learned to love this rhythm. The city empties, then fills, then empties again. Each cycle brings new faces and says goodbye to others. It's a place that's constantly renewing itself, even as the same buildings and streets remain.

The Huron River slows to a lazy crawl. Kayakers drift under the bridges. Someone is always playing guitar in the park.

This is the Ann Arbor that doesn't make it into the college brochures — the quiet version, the one that belongs to the people who stay.
