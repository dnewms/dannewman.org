Inspired by the success of the [Hungover Owls](http://hungoverowls.tumblr.com) tumblr, I had to make my own. Inspired by a gchat conversation among friends, I found the perfect idea: [First Grade Recipes](http://firstgraderecipes.tumblr.com).![Fingerpaint Au Jus](/assets/images/wp/2013/07/IMG_0597.jpg)

Part satire, part food picture book, part nostalgia, part surrealist art, I think you'll enjoy it. Go follow it or whatever you do on tumblr, and get ready for the book that should be out in the next few months. Take that, [Smitten Kitchen](http://www.smittenkitchen.com)!
