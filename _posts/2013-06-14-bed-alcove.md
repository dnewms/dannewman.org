Another pattern from Christopher Alexander that stubbed toes and those hurt by sharp bed frame corners can agree with is the bed alcove. He starts this pattern with this basic statement:
> Bedrooms make no sense.
And continues:
> The valuable space around the bed is good for nothing except access to the bed. And all the other functions -- dressing, working, and storage of personal belongings which people stuff uncomfortably into the corners of their bedrooms -- in fact, need their own space, and are not at all well met by the left over areas around a bed.
How true. A bed is the centerpiece of a bedroom, but if it is actually in the center, then the space around it is typically only good for getting into the bed (depending on the size of the room). It can make it difficult to squeeze in or access a dresser, and walking from one end of the room to another is usually hampered by the bed. His solution:
> Don't put single beds in empty rooms called bedrooms, but instead put individual bed alcoves off rooms with other nonsleeping functions, so the bed itself becomes a tiny private haven.
Putting a bed in an alcove strikes a sense of safe shelter, like a dog lying under a desk. Sure, bedrooms might not really be *bed*rooms once you take out the bed, but it opens up the space for so much more. And then you can have the excuse to put a bed right by the kitchen. It's not gluttony, it's *architecture*!
