I found two caterpillars on a single milkweed, and fearing for the low northern Michigan temperatures, brought them inside. They've escaped a few times since, and to make sure they don't try that again, I've set up 24-hour monitoring.

The webcam ran for about two weeks, capturing the full metamorphosis from hungry caterpillar to chrysalis to butterfly. It was one of those projects that started as a joke and turned into something genuinely fascinating to watch.

The caterpillars were voracious — they could strip a milkweed leaf in a matter of hours. And the moment of chrysalis formation was surprisingly fast. One minute you have a caterpillar hanging in a J-shape, the next you have a jade-green case with gold dots.

If you've never watched a monarch emerge from its chrysalis, I highly recommend it. The whole process takes about 10-15 minutes, and there's something almost magical about watching the crumpled, wet wings slowly expand and dry.
