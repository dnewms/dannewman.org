I found two caterpillars on a single milkweed, and fearing for the low northern Michigan temperatures, brought them inside. They've escaped a few times since, and to make sure they don't try that again, I've set up 24-hour monitoring. 

These are most likely the last of the summer Monarchs, who make the journey all the way to Mexico and can live for 9 months, compared to the generations that traveled north, who live from 2 to 5 weeks.

That's the equivalent of every fifth generation of humans living roughly 600 years.

A time lapse where nothing much happens:

**Updates:**
*9/5* - In less than an hour, one caterpillar formed its chrysalis, and the second quickly followed suit. They leave their heads outside the chrysalis -- I'll leave them there in case they want them once they come out. Repositioned camera. Now we wait.

*9/17* - The monarchs began to hatch. Chrysalis black with wings, the first emerged in the early afternoon. Unfortunately, as can happen with any change in life (a reason to fear it, no doubt), complications arose. From what we could discern, it spent too much time attempting to break out, and its wings dried too soon. The second hatched in the middle of the night, as we woke up to find it hanging at the top of its jar. After some falls as it got used to having just a handful of feet, it sat drying its wings on a nearby bush. Storms eventually rolled through, but no signs that they stopped this Monarch from beginning the journey. Fly above the cars and below the birds, pleasant Mexico awaits you.
