I just read Steve Jobs' biography by Walter Isaacson. This is after recently converting from an Android phone to an iPhone, and realizing that Apple products are just so gosh darn nice to use. The book itself gets a little bogged down in details midway through, as it seems to go over every piece of sushi or every strange diet Jobs had, but picks up again near the end. Maybe that's why they put pictures in the middle. A few thoughts:

	- Jobs seemed born to lead a company. With his disregard toward others' emotions and ability to manipulate others, he had no moral qualms about screwing people over and no problem getting the most out of his employees.
	- Even though he was the perfect person to lead a company, he kinda failed at leading a family life. By working so much, he missed knowing his kids - and as it was said elsewhere...I forget where...but having to authorize a biography so that your kids will know you doesn't sound like a great life.
	- Focus was key in bringing Apple back. After taking over Apple again, Jobs drew a square with four quadrants, marking the columns \"Consumer\" and \"Pro\", and marking the rows \"Desktop\" and \"Portable\", and then pushed to develop just four products to satisfy those four quadrants. It was like strapping a corset on a bloated bureaucracy until it acted like a start-up.
	- Pixar makes some darn good movies that make a heck of a profit. Also, there was a reason *Antz* and *A Bug's Life* came out around the same time.
