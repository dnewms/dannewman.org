This song is pretty great.  A light driving rhythm if that makes sense.  Then for the pre-chorus it dives into these vocal heavy bars which leads into an extremely sappy yet great chorus - \"when I wrap my arms around you, every mistake we made crumbles...\"

Not superb lyrics, but one of those songs that's like eating a pack of Gushers.  It gives you a short high, but instead of sugar it's a high off of good pop construction.  So either listen to this song or eat some Pixy Stix.
