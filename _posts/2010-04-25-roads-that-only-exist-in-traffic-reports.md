I'm convinced in order to justify having traffic reports every certain number of minutes, sometimes reporters have to fabricate traffic situations.  And to do this, fabricate roads.  The following is a list of suspected imaginary roads:

	- Dequindre

	- Mound

	- Crooks

	- Halsted

	- Livernois

	- Dixie Highway

	- Sashabaw

	- Haggerty
