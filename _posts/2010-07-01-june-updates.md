Apparently computers at public libraries are unequipped with SD card readers, so publishing pictures is still going to be elusive.  However, there might be pictures that show up on this site:

Tidbits:
- My toe infection subsided after purchasing new boots.
- We killed and ate two rattlesnakes that were in our camp.  Even if you've never eaten snake, it tastes like you think it would.
- Rattlesnakes can also climb trees, even ones you are cutting down.  They can also frighten you when you aren't paying attention and look up and they are sitting right there.
- I have a thick beard and cowboy hat.
- A '77 Trans Am might be in my future...

Miss y'all.
