I swear, I'm trying to upload pictures.  I'll make it work sometime, I promise.  Especially because new pictures include an awesome bear.  And video of bear.  From less than 50 yards away.  BEAR!

The trail we're working on is getting more beautiful the more north we go.  My hands are also getting more swollen the more we work.  Ibuprofen, or "trail worker candy", is becoming a good friend.

I'm off to depend on the kindness of good strangers, soon to be friends, near Pullman, WA.  Which, if you don't know, is near Moscow, ID.  Which, if you don't know, is Josh Ritter's hometown.  As Radiohead says, "everything, in its right place".
