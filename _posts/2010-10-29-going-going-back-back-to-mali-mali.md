Or, just going to Mali in late January.  To do some of my own [D.I.Y. Foreign Aid](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24volunteerism-t.html), but[ not too much](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/10/26/dont_try_this_abroad?page=full).

Oh, and a [list of animals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mammals_of_Mali) I will see.  Including [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennec_Fox).
