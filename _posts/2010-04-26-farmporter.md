I originally thought of FarmPorter for a summer grant, and then a summer project, but now that my summer is planned, I’m giving the idea up to whoever wants it.

There are a few aspects of the idea, and FarmPorter would probably be better if simplified to perform one of the following:

	-  Home delivery of CSA shares

	- Fractional CSA share purchasing

	- Subsidized CSA shares to low-income communities

	- Handling excess crops through online sales/food bank donation

	- Marketing CSAs beyond farmers markets
