I originally thought of FarmPorter for a summer grant, and then a summer project, but now that my summer is planned, I’m giving the idea up to whoever wants it.

There are a few aspects of the idea, and FarmPorter would probably be better if simplified to perform one of the following:

	-  Home delivery of CSA shares
	- Fractional CSA share purchasing
	- Subsidized CSA shares to low-income communities
	- Handling excess crops through online sales/food bank donation
	- Marketing CSAs beyond farmers markets

Please see this .pdf for more information.
