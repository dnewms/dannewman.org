[![](/assets/images/wp/2011/01/bcard-207x300.png)](/assets/images/wp/2011/01/bcard.png)You know what's missing on (most) business cards?  Pictures of the person.  How are you supposed to link the name and face?  And let's say you have a bunch of applicants for a job you are filling, do you want to sort through reams of resumes?  Does anyone actually read a resume anymore?  It's too long!  Just give me a list of where you've worked and a fancy title, and explain the rest in person!

While I'm in Africa, someone should make a business around these, baseball card business cards.  Now the picture is a quick mock-up.  A real designer should make the template.  On the back, I imagine a quick blurb, followed by a table of years and positions held at other companies.  Like the stuff already on your resume, but without all the filler.

Sure, some say that this will only advantage the beautiful more.  But in today's society, people need to have the skill to fake looking good in a profile picture.  Take a picture from one of those angles that makes you look reasonable!  You know the one.  And chances are a beautiful person hasn't even considered those kind of angles, let alone know they exist.  And making bad things look good is just another skill you can bring up to beat out the beautiful people in the interview.
