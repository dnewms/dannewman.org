Picture this:  You get off the plane at Detroit-Metro, get picked up by a driver, then dropped off in what appears to be an abandoned industrial park.  The driver gives you a paintball gun with 5 paintballs, then drives off.  It's only you, whoever you brought with you, and all that you can carry on your back.

Welcome to your very own post-apocalyptic vacation!  There are food stores of grain and canned food hidden around, maybe a J.J. Abrams-like monster wandering about, and some \"stray\" dogs.  You spot another vacationer, but are they friendly?  Why are they pointing their paintball gun at you?  Where did you put your gun?  Did that shadow just move?  Can you hook up that car battery to those Christmas-lights like Wall-E did?

Costs: large upfront cost of renovating an abandoned industrial park to be safe, small maintenance cost of food caches, security, limited utilities.
Benefits: tourism for Detroit, use of abandoned industrial park, awesome place to vacation.

If someone makes this (cough, Dan Gilbert, cough), let me be the first to go!
