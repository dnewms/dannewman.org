                    This site has existed in some form since 1996, when it was danssmileyplace.com — dedicated to the research and development of emoticon language on a Gateway 2000. The major work of that era was a "full screen smiley" depicting Tom Cruise rappelling from the ceiling in <em>Mission Impossible</em>.
